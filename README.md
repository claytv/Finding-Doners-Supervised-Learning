# Finding Doners with Supervised Learning
This is the first project of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. I completed this project in April 2019. 

The analysis can be found in the notebook 'finding_donors.ipynb'.

This is a link to the [HTML version of the notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/claytv/Finding-Doners-Supervised-Learning/blob/master/finding_donors.html) 

Udacity provided instruction for the project as well as a the visuals.py file to assist in visualization.

The goal of this project is to employ several supervised learving algorithms to accurately model individuals income using data collected from the 1994 U.S Census. 

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
